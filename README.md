# 🌐 Landing Pages & Hero Section Designs

This repository contains all my **landing page** and **hero section** design codes.  
I made this to keep my work organized and to share my front-end design practice with others.

## 📁 What’s Inside

- Different hero section designs  
- Simple landing page layouts  
- Clean HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript code  
- All files are organized in separate folders

Example:

Each folder has its own design (with `index.html`, `style.css`, etc.).

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Open any folder  
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the design

## 🙌 Why I Made This

- To practice front-end design  
- To keep all my hero section designs in one place  
- To reuse these designs later for real projects
